Measurement_model:
qsoverlay measurement models are separate to the measurement function in
quantumsim. In particular, these are designed to not have to worry about
repeatedly preparing a state and sampling it for measurement, and to
take care of measurement crosstalk. Later they should possibly be included in
quantumsim.
