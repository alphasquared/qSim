setup_functions: functions to assist in creating a setup file
for a qsoverlay circuit builder.

Gate-set creation:

A gate_set is a dictionary of allowed gates for a circuit,
containing the parameters for each gate.

Gates are stored as tuples:
    (name,q0,q1,...), where 'name' corresponds to
    a label in gate_dic, and q0, q1 corresponds to
    the involved qubits.

The parameters themselves are contained within a dictionary
that can be pulled out, combined with any kwargs sent to the
user, and pushed to quantumsim.

The following functions provide some assistance in gate-set
creation.

    namely, every 2 (or higher)-qubit gate will
    take on any qubit parameters from the first qubit
    in its list, and all gate parameters will be the
    same. This can be adjusted before or after within
    the gate set (parameters that are preset in the
    gate set beforehand will not be overwritten here).
